A simple but powerful **shopping list web app** that helps users add, edit, and track grocery items intelligently.  
It’s designed to make shopping faster, smarter, and a little more fun 😄  

## 💡 What It Does 

 **KrigzList** lets you:
- ✅ Add items you need to buy  
- ✏️ Edit or remove existing items  
- 📱 Save your list so it stays even when you refresh (using local storage)  
- 🧠 Automatically sort or categorize items to keep things organized  
- 🌙 Switch between light and dark modes for a better UI experience  

## 🧰 Technologies

- `⚛️ React.js  `
- `🧠 TypeScript  `

 ## Features

Here's what you can do with KrigzList

## 🛠️ How I Built It

- Started with the layout:
  Used HTML and CSS to create a simple but responsive structure.

- Added interactivity:
  Implemented JavaScript for adding, editing, and deleting items dynamically.

  Used localStorage so users don’t lose their list when they close the app.

- Smart logic:
  Added sorting and duplicate-checking features to keep the list tidy.

- UI polish:
  Styled with modern CSS (flexbox, transitions, and custom color themes).

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Managing data using the Local Storage API
- Improving UI/UX through responsive design
- Debugging with browser dev tools
- Writing cleaner, modular code with reusable functions
